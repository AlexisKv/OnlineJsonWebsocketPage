Real-Time Collaborative JSON Editor

## Overview

This web app, powered by the .NET SignalR library, allows users to collaborate on JSON files in real-time. Pick a file from the server - choose from `car.json`, `duck.json`, or `store.json` - and any changes made by one user are instantly visible to others working on the same file.


## Features

- **JSON Syntax Highlighting**: Editor supports syntax highlighting for better readability.

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Changes are instantly reflected for all collaborators.

- **File Download**: Users can download a copy of the currently edited JSON file.

- **Collaborator Tracking**: See who else is currently editing the file.

## Verification

To verify real-time collaboration, open two browser windows side-by-side, select the same JSON file in both, and observe changes made in one window being instantly reflected in the other.
